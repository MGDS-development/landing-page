		<p>This website have been created in the context of the Madrid Green Data Space (MGDS) project, funded from September to December 2020 by EIT Digital under a joint <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EIT-Cross-KIC-Call-to-Action-Guidelines-SGA2020-SusCity-MAD.pdf">Cross-KIC activity</a> with EIT Climate-KIC.</p>

 

		<p>The main objectives of this project included the generation of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a data space associated to the <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Healthy-Clean-Cities.pdf" >EIT Climate-KIC-funded Madrid Health, Clean Cities Deep Demonstration</a>, as well as a dashboard related to different aspects of the green infrastructure of the city of Madrid, providing digital support to some of the current experiments in the experiment portfolio.</p>


		<p>We have worked on the deployment of such a data space, following the main architectural components of the <a href="https://www.internationaldataspaces.org/ids-ram-3-0/">IDSA reference architecture</a>. As a result, the current data asset catalogue is available <a href="https://mgds.oeg.fi.upm.es/datasets.html">here</a>. We have also worked on the generation and exploitation of several green-infrastructure-related datasets, including open data published by the <a href="https://datos.madrid.es/">city of Madrid</a>, by the <a href="https://www.ign.es">Instituto Geográfico Nacional</a> and by <a href="https://scihub.copernicus.eu/">Copernicus</a>, generating derived data sources for the city of Madrid according to a set of well-known indicators around green infrastructure (NDVI, Green Space Index, Green Spaces Proximity Index, Green Space Density and Green-Space Built-Space Ratio), which are made available with a XXXXXXXXX license. The results can be visualized and navigated via a <a href="https://mgds.oeg.fi.upm.es/dashboard/">dashboard</a>. A continuously evolving beta version of this dashboard is available <a href="http://vps204.cesvima.upm.es:8080/">here</a>.</p>


		<p>The team was formed by members from two research groups at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid: the <a href="https://www.oeg-upm.net">Ontology Engineering Group</a> and the <a href="">XXXXX</a>.</p>
