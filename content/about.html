			<p>
			Our team at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid has worked together with the city of Madrid and the other teams that were selected under this call in order to generate an MVP of a data space associated to the Madrid Health, Clean Cities Deep Demonstration, with a special focus on the project on urban naturation (and more generally, on many aspects related to the green infrastructure of the city) in the current experiment portfolio.
			</p>
			<p>
			Our project was the only one among the four projects selected in this call that proposed to work in depth on aspects like the deployment of an architecture based on the current ongoing architectures and reference implementations for data spaces (e.g., the IDSA reference architecture and the upcoming GAIA-X), as well as on the general data governance of such a data space associated to the activities in the city of Madrid, Hence our data space implementation and governance model have been taken into account by these other projects.
